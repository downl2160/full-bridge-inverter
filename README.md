# üîå Full-Bridge Inverter - My 12th Class Electronics Project

This project is about building a basic circuit called a **Full-Bridge Inverter**. Its main job is to convert everyday battery power (DC - Direct Current) into the type of power used in homes (AC - Alternating Current). This is a cool beginner-friendly project for understanding how electricity can be switched around to create different kinds of power‚Äîjust like in big solar systems or UPS devices!

## üìù Project Summary

Imagine you have a battery (DC power) but want to power a small AC light bulb. That's where an inverter comes in!  
This project uses a special arrangement of electronic switches, called an **H-Bridge**, to rapidly turn the DC power on and off in different directions. This switching creates a **square-wave (or almost sine-wave)** AC output.

The goal is to see how we can make our own AC power from a DC source.

## üîß What It Does

- **Changes Battery Power (DC) to Wall Socket Power (AC):** Takes a steady flow of electricity (like from a 12V battery) and turns it into a back-and-forth AC flow.
- **Creates a "Square Wave" Output:** Unlike a smooth sine wave at home, this basic inverter makes a blocky, on-off-on-off wave.
- **Uses a Smart "H" Shape:** The H-bridge configuration allows current to flow in both directions.
- **Controlled by PWM (Pulse Width Modulation):** Fast ON/OFF pulses control the switches‚Äîdone using an Arduino or a 555 Timer.
